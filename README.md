# Device supported:
 - Brand: EStar
 - Model: Takee 1 (cheaper version of 2015 with single rear camera). 
 Quick specs [here][quickdevinfo]
 Detailed specs [here][detdevinfo]



# Download 3D libraries:
Some custom Roms don't include them, they're necessary for this app to work. I extracted them from the last stock rom and made a guide to import them correctly, you can download them [here][3dlibs] 



# Stock and custom ROMs for Takee 1:
[here][takeeroms] 

# Get involved :
 - We talk about this app on the international [XDA Forum][takeexda] community 
 - We also tried to involve the russian community translating and posting our summaries on the [4pda forum][takee4pda]
 - My takee1 is destroyed :( Would you like to donate your device or help me in other ways?

# Origin of this code:
Source code of the official app in stock ROMs.

# Advantage of this fork:
The source code of the 3d stock player has been converted from the old eclipse project to a new Android studio project by me, Mik-el.

# Relevance:
This app is the cornerstone for future developments of:
* Takee 1
* other 3D smartphones ([more][3dphones])
* other 3D devices with eye-tracking and Stereoscopic displays such as New Nintendo 3DS ([more][s3Ddevices])





# App Download
The download of this app is free. ([link][apkv1] - use slower download) but if you'll like to help me:
