# Download 3D libraries:
This app needs 3d libraries to work. Unfortunately some custom Roms don't include them, but I extracted them from the last stock rom and made a guide to import them correctly in any custom rom, you can download the libraries [here][3dlibs] 



# Stock and custom ROMs for Takee 1:
[here][takeeroms] 

# Get involved :
 - We talk about this app on the international [XDA Forum][takeexda] community 
 - We also tried to involve the russian community translating and posting our summaries on the [4pda forum][takee4pda]
 - My takee1 is destroyed :( Would you like to donate your device or help me in other ways?

# Origin of this code:
Source code of the official app in stock ROMs.

# Advantage of this fork:
* Converted the source code from an old Eclipse project to a new Android Studio project. (Mik-el)
* Optimized the code with Proguard (Mik-el)
* Added 4 new languages: Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German. (View Credits)
* Improved original English text 

# Relevance:
This app is the cornerstone for future developments of:
* Takee 1
* other 3D smartphones ([more][3dphones])
* other 3D devices with eye-tracking and Stereoscopic displays such as New Nintendo 3DS ([more][s3Ddevices])
